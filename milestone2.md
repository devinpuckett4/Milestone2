## - Conclusion

This milestone gave me a simple, working Spring Boot app I can explain and demo. I have a home page with a basic theme and navbar, a register and login flow with clear errors, and a products page after I sign in. It runs on 8080 and looks good on mobile with Bootstrap. I kept things readable with small controllers, one lightweight service, and Thymeleaf templates and fragments. No database or security yet.
